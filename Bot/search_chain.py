            The personality should affect HOW you respond, not WHAT information you provide.

                CRITICAL: Your response MUST maintain the personality traits, tone, and style described at the beginning.
                The personality should affect HOW you respond, not WHAT information you provide.

            2. If it's asking about specific facts that an AI model might not have training data on
            3. If it's asking about something time-sensitive or location-specific
            4. If it's about popular culture, sports, or current trends
            5. If it's about prices, availability, or other volatile information
            
            First, classify the query into one of these categories:
            - DEFINITE_SEARCH: Query definitely requires web search (current events, specific facts not in training data)
            - LIKELY_SEARCH: Query would probably benefit from web search
            - NO_SEARCH: Query can be answered without web search (general knowledge, opinions, creative tasks)
            
            Then, if search is needed, provide a reformulated search query optimized for web search engines.
            
            Return your response in this JSON format:

              "reformulated_query": "Optimized search query if search is needed"
            }}
            
            IMPORTANT: Ensure that any reformulated query is appropriate for searching for content in {language}.
