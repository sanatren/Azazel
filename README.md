Supercharging Legacy Models with multimodal capabilities

Azazel is your AI toolkit of choice that elevates GPT-3.5 Turbo and Legacy Models to the next level. By integrating RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), image processing , code execution, and web search, this project turns legacy models into a lean, mean, multimodal machine. From analyzing images, debugging code, to conversing with documents, Azazel makes legacy
models more intelligent, quicker, and more flexible—without the heavyweight price tag. 

## Why Azazel?

Advanced Image Analysis: Leverage GPT-4o-mini vision capabilities to analyze and interpret images, extracting meaningful insights and answering complex visual queries.

Intelligent Code Execution: Execute Python code securely in real-time, with detailed explanations and debugging support for programming tasks.

Document Intelligence: Chat with PDFs, Word documents, and other file formats using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for context-aware responses.

Real-Time Web Integration: Access and synthesize up-to-date information from the web, ensuring accurate and relevant answers to dynamic queries.

Multilingual Support: Seamlessly switch between languages for global accessibility and localized responses.

Speech Integration: Convert speech to text for hands-free interaction, enhancing accessibility and user experience.

Contextual Memory: Maintains conversation context across sessions, enabling coherent follow-ups and long-term interactions.

Model switching: Can change model according user needs for more complex or lightweight tasks (GPT-4 ↔ GPT-4 Turbo ↔ GPT-4o-mini ).

Sentiment analysis: for mood-aware responses.

Personality modes according to user and custum mode to define the assistant behaviour according to user
